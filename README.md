### How to run
You can use next command to run an exect file in the command line:
```javascript
babel-node --presets es2015 file_path/file_name.js
```
or via nodemon if you want life reload:
```javascript
nodemon file_path/file_name.js --exec babel-node
```

### Repository structure
Usually, you can find ``challenges`` folder in each structure folder: 
it contains different additional taks and implementations whicl could be useful to see.
